# Necto-Evals

This repository is largely a mess. I am using it to run evals for Necto models that exist in the models/ folder. I'm not pushing this folder because (1) it would be large and (2) these aren't my models to share. You can put your own checkpoints (non-jitted) in here and mess with the main, rlbot_agent, obs methods to work for your own bot.
